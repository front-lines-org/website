The **Battle of Bakhmut** is a series of military engagements near the city of Bakhmut between the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation during the battle for Donbas in 2022.

## Prelude
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a key Russian goal was to capture the Donbas region, consisting of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Following the battles of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in early July, Russia and separatist forces captured all of Luhansk oblast, and the battlefield shifted towards the cities of Sloviansk, Bakhmut, and Soledar. Prior to the battle in Bakhmut, Ukrainian Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy claimed that Russia held a five-to-one manpower advantage over Ukraine along the eastern front.

Starting on May 17, Russian forces began shelling Bakhmut, killing five people including a two-year-old child. After the fall of Popasna on May 22, Ukrainian forces withdrew away from the city to reinforce positions at Bakhmut. Meanwhile, Russian forces managed to advance on the Bakhmut-Lysychansk highway, endangering the remaining Ukrainian troops in the Lysychansk-Sievierodonetsk area. The Russian checkpoint along the highway was later demolished, although fighting resumed on May 30 along the Kostiantynivka-Bakhmut highway, where Ukrainian forces successfully defended the highway.

Shelling of Bakhmut continued throughout the rest of June and July, escalating after the battle of Siversk began on July 3. On July 25, Ukrainian forces withdrew from the Vuhlehirska Power Station, along with the nearby town of Novoluhanske, giving Russian and separatist forces a "small tactical advantage" towards Bakhmut. Two days later on July 27, Russian shelling of Bakhmut killed three civilians and wounded three more.

## Battle
On 1 August, Russian forces launched massive ground attacks on settlements south and southeast of Bakhmut. Both the Russian Ministry of Defense and pro-Russian Telegram pages claimed that the battle of Bakhmut had begun. The following day, Ukraine reported that Russian forces had ramped up airstrikes and shelling of the city, beginning a ground attack on the southeastern part of the city. Bombardment continued through 3 August. On 4 August, Wagner Group mercenaries managed to break through Ukrainian defenses and reach Patrice Lumumba street, on the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut.

On 10 August, Russian forces bombarded the central part of the city, killing seven civilians and injuring six more. Many buildings were damaged in the strike. In the following days, Russian forces continued to push towards Bakhmut from the south, with the Ukrainian general staff stating on 14 August that Russian forces had achieved "partial success" near Bakhmut, but offering no specifics.

From the night shelling in the center of the city burned the Martynov Palace of Culture, where the humanitarian headquarters worked. During the extinguishing of the fire, the local fire department was shelled, which reported that two SES staff were injured and equipment damaged. At night, a five-story building was partially destroyed by Russian shelling.

On 20 September, Aleksey Nagin, a commander in the Wagner Group, was killed near Bakhmut. Wagner Group forces on the frontlines in Bakhmut are also being bolstered by prisoners from Russia and allied breakaway states.

On 7 October, Russian forces advanced into the villages of Zaitseve and Opytne on the southern outskirts of Bakhmut, while on 10 October, the UK Defence Ministry claimed that Russian troops advanced closer to Bakhmut. A minor Ukrainian counteroffensive on October 24 pushed Russian forces from some factories on the eastern outskirts of the city.

On 27 October, Russian forces again took control of Bakhmut cement plant. Since then, Russia has targeted Bakhmut with Iranian made drones after 450 of them were sent to Russia in mid-October. Russia is now launching attacks at the supposed Bakhmut Furniture Factory since the capturing of the plant.
