The **Battle of Dhi Qar** (يوم ذي قار), also known as the War of the Camel's Udder, was a pre-Islamic battle fought between Arab tribes and the Sassanid Empire in Southern Iraq. The battle occurred after the death of Al-Nu'man III by the orders of Khosru II.

The dating of the event is disputed. The Encyclopedia Iranica entry on the subject says: ""According to certain Muslim traditions, the battle took place in the year 1/623 or 2/624... Ebn Ḥabīb... dated it earlier, between 606 and 622, but modern scholars have narrowed this range to 604-11""

The battle of Dhū-Qār is reported in many classical works of Arabic history and literature. The longest, but not necessarily most representative, version is Bishr ibn Marwān al-Asadī's *Ḥarb Banī Shaybān maʻa Kisrá Ānūshirwān* (حرب بني شيبان مع كسرى آنوشروان).
