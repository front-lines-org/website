The **2017 Western Nineveh offensive**, code-named *Operation Muhammad, Prophet of God*, was launched by the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in the western Nineveh province of northern Iraq in late April 2017.

## The offensive


### Push to the southwest
PMF forces launched their offensive against ISIL on 25 April, some 100 kilometers southwest of Mosul. PMF also launched an operation to clear the town of Al-Hadar and its surrounding villages from ISIL forces, seizing three villages. By the end of the first day, they had captured 12 villages in the region.

PMU announced during the afternoon of 26 April that they had captured the ruins of the ancient city of Hatra. They also stated they had advanced to the edge of the nearby modern town. The city is also strategically significant as it commands access to Nineveh, Saladin and Anbar Governorate. By the third day of the offensive, the PMF had captured 17 villages. They also took over 3 villages in the region during the day and another along with a cemetery. The nearby modern town of Al-Hadar was captured on 27 May. The advance cut-off several desert tracks used by ISIL to move between Iraq and Syria.

Three days later, the PMF pushed out of al-Hadar in three directions northwest of the town, capturing another five villages. Meanwhile, PMF intelligence announced that the operation in Al-Hadar was sudden and rapid and placed ISIL in a critical situation in the neighboring Baaj area. Some people started returning to their villages after the buildings had been cleared of mines by the PMF.

### Push to the west


#### Push to al-Qairawan
On 12 May, the PMF launched the second phase of their offensive, with an operation 100 kilometers west of Mosul. The aim was to secure the towns of al-Qairawan and Al-Ba'aj areas and push ISIL militants further towards the border with Syria. The offensive was backed by Iraqi Air Force's helicopters. The PMU later announced that it had captured four villages while clashing in two other villages. It later announced that it had captured 21 villages around al-Qairawan, killing 77 militants and destroying 15 VBIEDs.

On 13 May, PMF stated that it had captured four villages and surrounded one while also capturing the road between Shingal and Qairawan. The Joint Operations Command (JOC) stated during the day that they had captured 11 villages around al-Qairawan. The paramilitary forces surrounded the town from three sides, while cutting off the main roads between it and Tal Afar as well as Sinjar. It also stated that an Iraqi Air Force helicopter was shot down, after it came under fire from ISIL while supporting PMF to capture villages located in the desert to the west of Mosul.

The PMF stated on 14 May that it had captured the villages of Khailo and Tal al-Qasab near al-Qairawan besides surrounding another village.

Following a "quick overnight operation", the PMF seized the strategic town of Qayrawan and a number of villages on 23 May. The military stated that it had also captured all the villages around it. The paramilitary groups ended the first stage of their offensive to secure the border with Syria and cut off supply routes between Mosul and Raqqa.

On the next day, PMU fighters began a push to capture Al-Ba'aj, capturing four villages and a strategic road west of al-Qairawan. By the end of the day, the number of villages captured by the PMU increased to 9. ISIL headquarters were reportedly attacked in central al-Baaj, western Nineveh, and an ISIL emir was reportedly killed, according to local sources.

The War Media Cell said on 26 May that an airstrike launched by the Iraqi fighter jets, in support of PMU troops, left 46 militants dead, and four vehicles, two of which were booby-trapped, destroyed in Baaj and Qairawan regions.

On the next day, the 15th Infantry Division of the Iraqi Army advanced towards Mahlabiyah on 11 June, capturing five villages during the day. Earlier, the PMF had advanced to the area, but avoided entering the two towns of Tal Afar and Mahlabiyah. Dozens of militants were killed as Iraqi airstrikes destroyed militant locations in Tal Afar on 14 June.

JOC stated on 15 June that PMF had captured four villages to the north of Mahlabiyah, in addition to the nearby Mansour industry compound and water facility. War Media Cell announced on 21 May that airstrikes in al-Mahalabiya and Tal Afar town, killed 12 militants and destroyed two booby-trapped vehicles and weapons. Abu Abdullah al-Halabi, the assistant head of ISIL's so-called "security committee", was shot dead at the center of Tal Afar on 26 June, according to a local source.

Abu Hafsa, who was in charge of ISIL drones in Tal Afar, was killed along with a number of companions, after an airstrike hit a secret rest house of the group on the outskirts of Tal Afar, which was used for launching drones on 27 June according to a local source. Iraqi army officer Jabbar Hassan meanwhile said that the 15th Infantry Division had captured six villages outside Tal Afar.

## Aftermath
The spokesman of Iraq's Counter-Terrorism Service stated on 30 June 2017 that plans were in place to capture Tal Afar as well as Hawija and it would be ready to participate in the battle to take it. Chief of Staff of the Peshmerga Ministry Jabar Yawar told Rudaw on 2 June 2017 that the Iraqi government planned to advance military operations for Tal Afar and Al Anbar Governorate while delaying an offensive for Hawija.

According to a statement on 4 July by Nour Eddin Qablan, deputy chief of Nineveh provincial council, 200 Turkmens were reportedly held and killed by the militants in Tal Afar two months ago, while they were trying to flee to territory under Iraqi control. In addition, a local source stated that the last local leader of the town had been executed by non-Iraqi militants. Twelve militants were meanwhile reported on 8 July to have been killed in Tal Afar in three consecutive airstrikes including a top judiciary official according to local sources, while Ahmed al-Shamri of Nineveh Operations Command stated that the group had executed 10 members for trying to flee.

On 29 July, Prime Minister of Iraq Haider al-Abadi said that the Iraqi government had set a plan to take Tal Afar, "I have put forward a plan to liberate Tal Afar with the participation of all (kinds of) security services, in addition to the Hashd Shaabi and Asha'iry (tribal units)." The participation of Hashd Shaabi had concerned Turkey which doesn't want the offensive to change the region's ethnic composition. On 1 August, PMF's media bureau stated it had captured seventeen villages to the south of Tal Afar. Iraqi forces on 20 August launched an offensive to recapture Tal Afar.
