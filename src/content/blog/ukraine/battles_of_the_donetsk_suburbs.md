The **Battles of the Donetsk Suburbs** are a continuation of the series of battles for the control of the western suburbs of Donetsk that began on August 15, 2022, after the Russian seizure of the settlement of Pisky just weeks prior. The areas contested are mainly Pervomaiske, Vodiane and surrounding cities of Donetsk and Avdiivka.

## Background
Throughout the Eastern Ukraine campaign in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the frontlines around the city of Donetsk had been relatively stagnant due to eight years of a frozen border between the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Ukraine. Major battles occurred in Avdiivka and Marinka, but since March 2022, the only major victory for either side was the Russian capture of Pisky in August 2022, after razing it to the ground. The town of Pervomaiske lies directly west of Pisky, and the village of Vodiane is directly to the north of Pisky, separated by a pond. Capturing Netailove, a village north of Pervomaiske will lead to an opportunity to capture Karlivka. Following the Russian capture of Pisky sometime before August 24, units of the DPR and Russian forces launched their first attacks near Pervomaiske, but with no conclusive result.

## Battle
The first attack on Pervomaiske was on August 15, after DPR-Russian forces launched attacks on the town. Russian Telegram channels claimed that elements of the DPR's 100th Brigade participated in these assaults. Further attacks were recorded on August 25, 30, and 31, according to the Ukrainian General Staff, but there was no discernible result. Russian forces also began launching assaults towards Vodiane on August 15, but little is known about them. On August 17, Russian forces made unspecified gains in Opytne, a hamlet east of Vodiane. Russian forces launched attacks again on August 18 and 19, towards Pervomaiske and Vodiane, but with no success. Throughout the end of August, clashes continued along the E50 highway between Pervomaiske and Pisky, with no solidified gains on either side. During this time, Russian forces consolidated gains in Pisky, and the last Ukrainian units in the town retreated towards Pervomaiske, forming a line of defense between the towns of Nevelske, Krasnohorivka, and Pervomaiske.

Throughout early September, Russian attacks between Pervomaiske and Pisky continued, although attacks on Vodiane slowed. The 11th Regiment of the DPR played a role in some attacks. On September 5, pro-Russian bloggers claimed that Russian troops had entered the city limits of Pervomaiske by capturing a bridge, although on that same day, Ukrainian General Staff reports claimed territory further south of the town, including Spartak and Pisky. President of the DPR, Eduard Basurin, claimed the offensives on Pisky were part of a larger attempt to encircle Avdiivka. Russian attacks and Ukrainian counterattacks severely decreased after September 11, with none reported until September 20. In late September, Russian forces also launched attacks on roads near Vodiane, with unknown results. Sometime in September, Russian forces captured the unfinished Republica Mist overpass, which had become a Ukrainian stronghold after fighting broke out in 2015.

On October 8, the 11th regiment and the Somali Battalion of the DPR attacked Pervomaiske again, with unknown results. In late October, Russian forces launched a localized offensive on Vodiane, beginning on October 23 and allegedly capturing the eastern part of the town on October 30. Ukrainian government sources claimed that Russian forces went on the offensive near the towns again on November 11, with eight repelled attacks. In November 2022, a failed DPR attack on Pervomaiske saw two DPR tanks damaged, with fighting still taking place near the unfinished Republica Mist overpass. Further Ukrainian attacks temporarily dislodged Russian troops in southcentral Pervomaiske. By the end of 2022, Russian forces had captured Opytne and the southern half of Vodiane.

In mid-January, a larger battle for Vodiane took place, with Ukrainian intelligence learning about the battle a week before it took place. On January 15, around 9-10 in the morning, elements of the DPR's 1st Slovyanska Separate Mechanized Brigade attacked eastern Vodiane from a frozen-over flooded area west of Opytne. These elements were not supported by artillery. At 12pm, a convoy of eight to nine Russian BMP-2s heading towards west Vodiane (Ukrainian-controlled territory) was hit by Ukrainian fire, injuring 70% of the soldiers involved according to the Russian commander of the attack. Two T-72Bs then approached the town, but were destroyed. A third attack took place in the afternoon, with some BMPs attempted to drive close to the bridge between Vodiane and Opytne (which had been destroyed during the fighting), but were also destroyed by artillery. According to the platoon commander, fighting in Vodiane that night, like nearly every night, was non-existent as there is no visibility. There were also attacks on Sieverne, west of Avdiivka.

In late January, Russian forces also claimed to capture the center of Pervomaiske, but this was unverifiable at the time. In February 2023, pro-Russian media falsely claimed that the village had been fully captured by Russian forces. A group of Russian soldiers from the "Storm" detachment from Kaliningrad released a video in March 2023, claiming they were suffering large losses while fighting in Vodiane. Russian attacks on Vodiane intensified on March 15, 2023. By early April 2023, Russian troops likely controlled most of Vodiane and had reached northeast Netailove. The Ukrainian general staff claimed to have repelled Russian attacks in the surrounding areas.

## Impact
On March 24, 2023, a man was killed in Pervomaiske from Russian shelling.

Russian fighters in Vodiane claimed that there is "not a single living creature in the town" from the destruction.
