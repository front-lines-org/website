The **Berdiansk port attack** was a strike carried out by Ukrainian forces against Russian Navy ships moored in the Port of Berdiansk on 24 March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The *Saratov* was sunk, and one of the two s took damage but was able to leave the port.

At the time, it was the heaviest naval loss suffered by Russia during the invasion, and one of Ukraine's most significant successes.

## Background

On 26 February 2022, Russian troops captured the Port of Berdiansk and the Berdiansk Airport. By the following day, the Russian military had taken full control of the city.

Beginning on 14 March, the port was used as a logistics hub by the Russians to support their offensive in southern Ukraine and in particular the siege of Mariupol. On 21 March, Russian media Zvezda reported on the arrival of amphibious transports in Berdiansk. A Russian navy officer described it as "a landmark event that will open logistical possibilities to the Black Sea Navy".

## Attack
The attack occurred at 7:45 on 24 March. Fire onboard the *Saratov* caused a large explosion, as the vessel was apparently laden with ammunition. Russia reported that the ship had sunk following a fire and explosions, but did not mention the Ukrainian attack. The explosion caused damage to two nearby s, the, and the. Both of these ships escaped the port while fighting their own fires, and later returned to Crimea. Other damage included large oil tanks on the pier and a nearby merchant ship that had been moored there since before the invasion, both of which were still burning the next day.

Ukrainian officials claimed that the attack was carried out with a OTR-21 Tochka tactical ballistic missile.

## Aftermath
Satellite imagery later confirmed the *Saratov* had sunk in the harbour, with its superstructure visible above the surface. Unconfirmed reports suggested that eight crewmen were killed on the *Caesar Kunikov* and three on the *Novocherkassk*, but losses on the *Saratov* were not reported.

British intelligence assessed that the sinking of the *Saratov* would damage the Russian Navy's confidence to operate close to the Ukrainian coastline. As of 31 March, no further attempts to resupply with amphibious ships had been observed, according to the United States Department of Defense.

At the time, the attack that sank *Saratov* was not mentioned by Russia. On 2 July Russia announced that the ship had been damaged by a missile strike and scuttled by its crew "to prevent detonation of the on-board munitions", and that it had been salvaged and would be towed to Kerch in Crimea.
