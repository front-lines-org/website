The **Battle of Paraskoviivka** was a strategic encirclement mainly located in and around the settlement of Paraskoviivka in eastern Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Part of the larger Battle of Bakhmut, the battle and later siege lasted from 15 January 2023 to 17 February 2023. The engagement as a whole saw heavy fighting from the Russian Armed Forces (alongside the Wagner Group) and the Ukrainian Armed Forces for control of Paraskoviivka, a large settlement located north of the strategic city of Bakhmut. The battle lasted for over a month, starting after the Battle of Soledar and ending with the Russian capture of the village and surrounding area, which allowed an offensive into northern Bakhmut.

The Russian siege of Paraskoviivka started shortly after hostilities began, but intensified between 10 and 12 February 2023 when Krasna Hora, a nearby town, fell under Russian control. Russia later captured one of the settlement's main roads which connected it to Berkhivka, another town adjacent to Paraskoviivka. Over 1,500 Ukrainian soldiers were reported to be inside of the village at the time of the road's capture, making the situation in Paraskoviivka dire for Ukraine. Small counterattacks were attempted by both armies, which increased the siege's intensity.

The battle ending in a Russian victory on 17–18 February 2023. Immediately afterward, Russia began an offensive across the entire region of northern Bakhmut, moving first towards Berkhivka and Yahidne, and then towards Dubovo-Vasylivka. All of these settlements were also captured by Russian forces.

## Background

As part of a winter escalation in late December 2022, the Russians launched an offensive to capture the Soledar - Bakhmut region, a strategic target because of its position in Donetsk Oblast. On 11–16 January 2023, Russian forces were reported to have captured Soledar. With the capture of Sil, a village some 6 kilometers from Paraskoviivka, the railway line was cut off. On 24 January 2023, fighting reached Paraskoviivka, which had been almost completely encircled. Nearby Krasna Hora had also come under heavy attack.
