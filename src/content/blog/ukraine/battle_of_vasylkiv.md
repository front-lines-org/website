The **Battle of Vasylkiv** was a military engagement reported to have taken place between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on 26 February 2022, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

## Battle
In the early morning of 26 February, according to Ukrainian media, paratroopers of the Russian Airborne Forces began landing near the city of Vasylkiv, 40 km south of Kyiv, in an attempt to secure Vasylkiv Air Base. Heavy fighting between the Russian paratroopers and Ukrainian defenders occurred in the city.

According to Ukrainian officials, at 01:30, a Ukrainian Su-27 fighter jet shot down a Russian Ilyushin Il-76, killing upwards of 250 elite Russian paratroopers with a single missile. At 03:20, a second Il-76, this one carrying over 100 paratroopers, was also allegedly shot down over the nearby city of Bila Tserkva. As of September 2022 no wreckage of the planes has been found.

The mayor of Vasylkiv, Natalia Balasynovych, stated that over 200 Ukrainians were wounded in the engagement. She later claimed that Ukrainian forces had repelled the assault by Russian paratroopers on the military air base near the city and the central street, with the situation in the city having calmed down. *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Ukrainian forces patrolled the city in the morning and were searching for Russian stragglers.

Confirmation of the Russian Il-76 losses has yet to be produced. According to The Guardian, "no convincing public evidence has surfaced about the two downed planes, or about a drop of paratroopers in Vasylkiv".

The New York Times cited unnamed Ukrainian officials, that at least part of the attackers were sleeper cells, who, according to the mayor of Vasylkiv, Natalia Balasynovych, had bought apartments and brought their families in the month before the invasion. Ukrainian territorial defense units had not found any evidence of wrecked planes in the surrounding area.

## Aftermath


### February and March
In the early morning of 27 February, a Russian missile struck an oil depot in Vasylkiv, setting it ablaze. On 12 March, a Russian rocket attack destroyed the air base.

### April
On 2 April 2022 the whole of Kyiv Oblast, where Vasylkiv is located in, was declared free of "invaders" by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense after Russian troops had left the area.
