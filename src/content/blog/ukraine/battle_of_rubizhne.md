By the following day, the LPR was in control of portions of Rubizhne, while fighting continued in the southern part of the town. Between 19 and 20 March, Russian and LPR forces captured the village of Varvarivka, north of Rubizhne.

On 22 March, the head of the LPR, Leonid Pasechnik, claimed that "almost 80% of the territory" of the Luhansk region was taken and "Popasna, Lysychansk, Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk and Kreminna have not been liberated". He noted that the situation in the battlefields is "stably tense" and units of the People's Militia of the LPR were striving to take Popasna and Rubizhne under control. Two days later, Russian forces made advances in Rubizhne.
