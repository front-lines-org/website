Ukrainian military commentator Yuri Butusov listed the following initial March 2022 deployment of Russian/allied forces:

**Southwestern Belarus grouping** (blocking contingent against Ukrainian forces in Western Ukraine):

**Southeastern Belarus grouping** (Kyiv offensive direction):

**Bryansk grouping** (Chernihiv offensive direction):

**Kursk – Belgorod grouping** (Sumy offensive direction):

**Voronezh grouping** (Kharkiv offensive direction):

**Smolensk grouping** (operational reserve of the northern front)

**Rostov grouping** (Donbas and eastern Sea of Azov offensive direction)

**Crimea grouping** (southern Ukraine offensive direction):

**Kuban grouping** (operational reserve of the southern front)

### Russian leaders 2022-23
 * Aleksandr Dvornikov (8 April 2022 – 25 June 2022): placed in overall charge of military operations in Ukraine, effectively ending the grouping system;
 * Gennady Zhidko (26 June 2022 – 7 October 2022): appointed by Vladimir Putin to the top position, replacing Dvornikov;
 * Army General Sergey Surovikin (8 October 2022 – 11 January 2023): previously commander of the Aerospace Forces and Army Group South, replacing Zhidko in overall command.
Despite evolving Russian doctrine which specified all troops and forces operating from one Operational-Strategic Command (OSK) be placed under one commander, multiple repeated sources (Rochan Consulting, Center for Naval Analysis, British Ministry of Defence) reported that separate groupings of forces drawn from each of the four military districts, under the leadership of senior personnel from that military district, took part in the initial invasion. President Vladimir Putin was repeatedly reported as taking a very involved stance, sometimes giving orders to field formations.

In April 2022 the invasion began to run into setbacks; Russian forces were forced to withdraw from their attempt to take Kyiv. Therefore to handle a longer war, a single coordinating senior officer was appointed.



## Russian/affiliated forces estimate 2023
From 12 January 2023 Army General Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the General Staff, was appointed as commander of military operations in Ukraine, with Surovikin as his deputy.

### Administrative chain of command
 * **🇷🇺 Russia** (President of the Russian Federation: Supreme Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Putin)
 * Security Council
 * Rosgvardiya (General of the Army Viktor Zolotov; Deputy Commander Lieutenant General Roman Gavrilov)
 * Federal Security Service (General of the Army Alexander Bortnikov)
 * Russian Border Guards (Deputy Director of the Federal Security Service and Head of the Border Service: Vladimir Kulishov)
 * Federal Protective Service (Director of the Federal Protective Service: General Dmitry Kochnev)
 * Ministry of Internal Affairs (Minister of Internal Affairs: Vladimir Kolokoltsev)
 * Police of Russia
 * Ministry of Defence (Minister of Defence: General of the Army Sergei Shoigu)
 * Russian General Staff (Chief of the General Staff: General of the Army Valery Gerasimov, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff Nikolay Bogdanovsky); National Defense Management Center (Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev)
 * GRU (Director: Admiral Igor Kostyukov)
 * 8th Directorate - Directorate Spetsnaz (Spetsnaz GRU)
 * Russian Ground Forces (Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Ground Forces and Deputy Minister of Defence: General of the Army Oleg Salyukov)
 * Russian Engineer Troops (Lieutenant General Yuri Stavitsky)
 * Russian Missile Troops and Artillery (Lieutenant-General Mikhail Matveyevsky)
 * Russian Tank Troops
 * Russian Air Defence Troops
 * Army Aviation component
 * Logistical Support of the Russian Armed Forces (Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev, who replaced Army General Dmitry Bulgakov in September 2022)
 * Russian Railway Troops
 * Russian Aerospace Forces (Commander-in-Chief of the Aerospace Forces and Deputy Minister of Defence: General of Army Sergey Surovikin)
 * Russian Air Force (Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Aerospace Forces: Lieutenant General Sergey Dronov)
 * Russian Airborne Forces (Commander of the Russian Airborne Forces: Colonel-General Mikhail Teplinsky who replaced Colonel General Andrey Serdyukov in June 2022
 * Russian Navy (Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy and Deputy Minister of Defence: Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov)
 * Coastal Troops of the Russian Navy (Lieutenant General Viktor Astapov)
 * Russian Naval Infantry (Lieutenant General Aleksandr Kolpachenko)
 * Russian Naval Aviation (Major-General Igor Kozhin)
Commanders of the various MOD armed services and branches do not have operational control over the forces. They are responsible for force development and generation. The Chiefs of the ground forces, the aerospace forces, the navy, the strategic missile forces and the airborne forces also hold the appointments of Deputy Ministers of Defence, junior to the Chief of the General Staff, who is the First Deputy Minister of Defence.

The General Staff commands and controls forces through the National Defence Management Centre (NDMC). Operational control of the forces is carried out by the five Operational-Strategic Commands - the Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Military Districts and the OSK Northern Fleet, which is their equal. The Western and the Southern Military Districts share borders with Ukraine and are directly involved in the command and control of the operations.

Pre-2022 Russian military doctrine had specified that on the outbreak of war, armed forces from non-MOD services (like Rosgvardiya) would be placed under the General Staff.



## Operational chain of command
 * **🇷🇺 Russia** (President of the Russian Federation: Supreme Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Putin)
 * Security Council
 * Russian General Staff (Chief of the General Staff: General of the Army Valery Gerasimov, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff Nikolay Bogdanovsky)
 * National Defense Management Center (Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev)
 * Long Range Aviation - administratively Aerospace Forces; operationally, air operations centre of whatever description
 * 22nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Division (Colonel Mykola Varpahovych)
 * 52nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment (Tupolev Tu-22M) (Colonel Oleg Timoshyn)
The actual operational chain of command of the Russian military effort in Ukraine is not public, changes, and is a mix of state and non-state bodies. Personal rivalries are evident. President Vladimir Putin however remains firmly in control, sometimes micromanaging. The loose connection of various mercenary bodies and Ramzan Kadyrov's Chechens to the official command chain has been represented by placing them under headers separate to the Russian Armed Forces.

Forces from the Central and Eastern MD, the OSK Northern Fleet, and from other branches (Airborne Forces, Long Range Aviation, National Guard) may be operationally transferred to the Western & Southern Military Districts for active operations in Ukraine.

Scheduling and control of tactical fighter, ground attack, and strategic bomber "sorties" (one flight of one aircraft) is unclear.

On 18 April 2023 Russian official spurces said that President Putin had held meetings in the Kherson area with several commanders. The President "..received reports from the commander of the Dnepr forces grouping, General Lieutenant Oleg Makarevich, the commander of the Vostok [Eastern] forces grouping, General Lieutenant Andrey Kuzmenko, and the deputy commander of the combined grouping, General Colonel Mikhail Teplinsky." The meetings likely took place before April 16.
