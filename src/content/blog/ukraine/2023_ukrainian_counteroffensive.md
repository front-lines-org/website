In early June 2023, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine launched a counteroffensive against Russian forces occupying its territory. These efforts were made in several directions, including Donetsk Oblast, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and others.

## Background
Following the Kherson and Kharkiv counteroffensives in late 2022, fighting on the front lines largely stagnated, with fighting mostly concentrated around the city of Bakhmut during the first half of 2023. Meanwhile, Russia built an 800-kilometer-long defensive line in preparation for a Ukrainian counteroffensive. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russia constructed roughly three lines of defense: a 150-km-long front line from Vasylivka to Novopetrykivka (located on the Zaporizhzhia Donetsk border); a 130-km-long second line of defense from Orlyanske to just north of Bilmak; and "a constellation of disconnected fortifications surrounding larger towns". In Donetsk Oblast, Russian forces constructed field fortifications 5 km apart, much closer together than the 30 km of distance between the defenses in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. These fortifications center around Olhynka, Donetsk, Makiivka, Tokmak, and Horlivka. The defensive positions in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk Oblasts consist "of multiple types of anti-vehicle barriers, infantry trenches, and prepared firing positions for artillery and fighting vehicles."

## Prelude
In the days before the Ukrainian counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces engaged in "shaping operations" to test Russian defenses and weaken logistics and supply chains deep inside Russian-occupied territories. On June 3, 2023, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine was ready to launch a counteroffensive. The next day, Ukrainian officials declared an "operational silence" to avoid compromising military operations. On June 6, the Kakhovka Dam on the Dnipro River was destroyed, flooding vast areas downstream and reducing water supplies to Crimea. As the counteroffensive began, Russian Armed Forces shelled Kherson, where rescuers were evacuating residents threatened by flooding.

### Pre-counteroffensive operations


#### Southern front
Starting on June 3, the Ukrainian 37th Marine Brigade engaged in a slow but consistent offensive action around the frontline settlement of Novodonetske in the Donetsk Oblast. Without armored support, the marines were able to push back the Vostok Battalion of the DNR's people's militia mostly through the use of artillery. The Ukrainian advance was further aided by the use of armoured personnel carriers (APC's) to rapidly transport marines to the front, and then withdrawing out of Russian artillery range. Ukraine made further limited tactical gains on June 4 in western Donetsk Oblast and eastern Zaporizhia Oblast, including northeast of Rivnopil.

By June 5, Russian milbloggers reported accelerated Ukrainian offensive actions in eastern Ukraine, concentrated against the Novodonetsk area, between Vuhledar (the site of an ongoing battle) and Velyka Novosilka in southern Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian forces made gains southwest of Velyka Novosilka and northwest of Storozheve. Although Ukrainian officials remained largely silent on the matter, there was speculation that these offensive actions were the beginning of the long-awaited counteroffensive. A Russian-appointed official in Zaporizhzhia Oblast said the Ukrainians aimed to break through Russian lines and reach the Azov Sea. Between June 6 and 7, Ukrainian forces conducted further counterattacks in eastern Zaporizhzhia and western Donetsk.

#### Bakhmut
In May 2023 Ukrainian forces were engaged in "localized" counterattacks on the flanks of Bakhmut, as part of its larger battle. On May 12 Ukrainian forces forced the Russians out of the southern bank of the Berkhivske Reservoir, about 4 km northwest of Bakhmut. Ukraine claimed further gains between May 16 and 18, 2023, saying they had liberated 20 km2 in the north and south of the suburbs of Bakhmut.

Beginning on June 5, Ukrainian forces engaged in large-scale counterattacks in and around the city of Bakhmut. That day it was reported that Ukrainian forces had retaken part of the village of Berkhivka, north of Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces claimed to have advanced further around the flanks of Bakhmut, 200–1600 metres toward Orikhovo–Vasylivka and Paraskoviivka in the north, and 100 to 700 meters near Ivanivske and around Klishchiivka in the southwest. A Ukrainian military official said that the Ukrainians had advanced from 300 metres to one kilometre around the northern and southern flanks of Bakhmut. On June 6, 2023, further Ukrainian counterattacks were reported near Berkhivka, and Ukraine claimed further gains of 200 – 1,000 meters near Bakhmut on June 7.

## Counteroffensive


### Eastern front (Donetsk, Kharkiv and Luhansk oblasts)
On June 8 Ukrainian forces advanced in the direction of Bakhmut, making gains of between 200 metres to 1.1 km, with further limited gains on June 9. By June 10, Ukrainian forces had advanced up to 1,400m in different unspecified areas of the Bakhmut front and were engaged in heavy fighting in Berkhivka and Yahidne. By June 9 Ukrainian forces advanced along the western bank of the Siverskyi Donets Canal west of Andriivka, and forced the 57th Motorized Infantry Brigade and a "Storm-Z" penal battalion to withdraw from their positions on the canal.

On June 11, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar announced that Ukrainian forces had advanced 250 meters along the Berkhivka Reservoir in the Bakhmut front on June 11. On June 12 Ukrainian forces conducted further counter attacks near Klishchiivka, in the vicinity of Bakhmut, and both Russian and Ukrainian sources claimed Ukrainian forces advanced in this area. On June 13, Ukrainian forces continued to advance on the southern and northern flanks of Bakhmut. Additionally, Russian forces conducted counterattacks in the vicinity of Bakhmut. According to Deputy Defense Minister Maliar, Ukrainian troops advanced 250 meters near the Berkhiv reservoir in Bakhmut and 200 meters on the Toretsk front. On June 14, Ukrainian forces conducted further counterattacks in the Bakhmut area, with Hanna Maliar reporting Ukrainian advances. Russian forces were additionally reported to have staged offensive operations in the Bakhmut area.

Also on the 14th of June, a large concentration of Russian troops from the 20th Army where awaiting a speech from Major General Sukhrab Akhmedov behind the front line in the Luhansk Oblast when the congregation was attacked by Ukrainian M142 HIMARS strikes. Reports from both Ukrainian and Russian media state that 100 Russian troops died, and a further 100 where wounded.

On 15 June, Ukrainian Deputy Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar gave an update on Telegram. Claiming an advance of two-five hundred metres near Bakhmut. While facing “stiff resistance” from Russian forces.

### Southern front (western Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts)
On June 8 Ukrainian forces launched counter attacks around the city of Orikhiv, in the Polohy Raion of the Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where Russian forces had constructed the Mala Tokmachka-Polohy defensive line. The attacks focused around the front line villages of Robotyne and Verbove, Polohy Raion, Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Ukrainian forces broke through the first lines of defense, held by the 58th Combined Arms Army and the GRU, causing Russian forces to fall back to a second line of defense. The Russian forces would later stage a counterattack, retaking the original line. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), an independent think tank, noted that the Russian Southern Military District, in charge of the defense of this line, acted with an "uncharacteristic degree of coherency" in their defensive operations. Russian sources offered various explanations for the success of the initial defense, such as effective mining, air superiority, and the use of electronic warfare (EW) systems. U.S. officials and the Russian Ministry of Defence reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffered "significant losses" during the attacks. U.S. officials said the losses are not expected to affect the counteroffensive as a whole.

Also on June 8 Ukrainian forces conducted counterattacks on the border between Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts, with fighting reported in the direction of Velyka Novosilka. By June 9, Ukrainian forces had made marginal gains on the border between Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts in Blahodatne, which is in the vicinity of Velyka Novosilka, and Russian forces had retreated from positions west of Storozheve. On June 10 Russian sources said Ukraine had advanced near Neskuchne, and on June 11 Russian sources announced a Russian withdrawal from Neskuchne, the Ukrainians later confirming that the city was liberated. Alongside Neskuchne, the settlement of Makarivka, Donetsk Oblast was also reported to have been liberated. Ukrainian drone footage shows Russian forces have withdrawn from their positions near Storozheve. Ukraine is credited with capturing 95 km2 of territory around Velyka Novosilka after a week of fighting.

On June 9 more fighting was reported in the vicinity of Orikhiv, with Ukrainian forces advancing with a mixture of Leopard tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Ukrainian forces on their "results" in the east of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces were seen operating in the vicinity of Lobkove, and a Russian milblogger claimed Ukrainian forces made gains in Robotyne, both located in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, south of Orikhiv.

By June 10 Ukrainian forces made further gains south and west of Lobkove, and west of Novopokrovka. On June 11, the ISW reported that the 19th Motorized Rifle Division of the 58th Combined Arms Army alongside the Tsar's Wolves milita, and the North Ossetian units "Storm Ossetia” and "Alania” where unable to hold onto Lobkove and withdrew, leaving the village in Ukrainian hands.

On June 11 the 68th Jaeger Brigade, alongside several territorial defence battalions had liberated the village of Blahodatne marking the third settlement to be liberated by Ukrainian forces during the counteroffensive. Later that same day, the neighboring village of Makarivka was also confirmed to have been liberated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in a press release. In total, Ukrainian forces advanced between 300 and 1,500 meters. As Russian forces withdrew from Makarivka, Major General Sergei Goryachev, chief of staff for the 35th Combined Arms Army, was killed in an “enemy missile attack”, according to a Russian milblogger. The Ukrainian military claimed Russian forces destroyed a dam on the Mokri Yaly river to slow down their advance.

The ISW assessed that between June 10 and 11 Ukrainian forces had liberated Makarivka, Neskuchne, Blahodatne, Storozheve, and Novodarivka in western Donetsk but reiterated that claims of a Ukrainian "breakthrough" are premature at this time. They also reported that this advance had been against largely forces of the 5th Combined Arms Army including the "Kaskad" Operational Combat Tactical Formation of the DNR People's Militias, the 127th Motorized Rifle Division, and the 336th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade. The ISW also reported marginal Ukrainian gains in the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line on June 11 against the Russian 3rd Army Corps.

By June 12 Reuters estimated that Ukrainian forces were 90 kilometres (55 miles) from the Sea of Azov. On the same day, Ukrainian forces made further gains west of Novodonetske. Russian forces also reportedly conducted a counterattack in the Vremivka area, where Ukrainian forces had made gains the previous day. Additionally in their June 12 report, the ISW assessed that fighting had shifted away from Orikhiv and reiterated claims of an advance along the Velyka Novosilka front. They also reported that Russian forces in Rivnopil are facing encirclement, but their exact situation is unclear. Also on June 12, Ramzan Kadyrov announced that his Kadyrovites had engaged Ukrainian forces in Makarivka. Overnight, Ukrainian forces advanced up to one kilometer in the direction of Berdyansk, according to officials.

On June 13, Russia conducted counterattacks aiming to recapture Makarivka, while Ukrainian forces continued ground attacks near Orikhiv. As of June 14, offensive actions have bogged down due to prolonged rain, according to a Russian blogger, reducing both sides to shelling each other with artillery. A Polish expert likewise claimed that Ukraine had lost momentum, estimating that Ukraine may have lost up to 15% of Bradley fighting vehicles. Despite this, Ukrainian forces still conducted counterattacks near Makarivka and Orikhiv, and reportedly made additional gains. On June 15, some advances of three to five hundred meters were reportedly made in the Zaporizhzhia region.

## Units involved
According to Western media, Ukrainian forces had built up an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 soldiers for the counteroffensive, organized into twelve brigades. Three of these were trained in Ukraine, and the other nine were trained and equipped by the United States.

## Analysis
The Ukrainian counteroffensive drew comparisons to D-Day, with the operation seen as a critical moment in the war. Victory in the counteroffensive would be interpreted by Western leaders as demonstrating that Western military aid to Ukraine was justified and that Ukrainian victory was possible, which would encourage Western military aid to continue. Depending on the specific goals of the offensive, victory could weaken Russia's strategic position in the war.

On June 9, the ISW assessed that there was confusion within the Russian information space as to who was really in charge of the defensive operations. There was speculation that Alexander Romanchuk, Mikhail Teplinsky, Sergey Kuzovlev, or Valery Gerasimov, could all be the district commander, with the ISW assessing that there are "likely overlapping" commanders. The ISW also assessed that Ukraine had not committed its full reserves and western equipment to the counteroffensive as of June 9, and that material losses sustained up to that point would not necessarily impact the course of the counteroffensive.

On June 10, 2023, the British Ministry of Defence stated, "In some areas, Ukrainian forces [had] likely made good progress and penetrated the first line of Russian defences. In others, Ukrainian progress [had] been slower."

Western supplied equipment including night vision may be giving Ukrainian forces "tactical advantages" during night fighting, according to Russian sources cited by the ISW, who say this would make it easier for Ukraine to conduct nighttime attacks.
