The **Battle of Irpin** was part of the Kyiv offensive in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine for control of the city of Irpin. The combatants were elements of the Russian Armed Forces and Ukrainian Ground Forces. The battle lasted from 27 February 2022 to 28 March 2022 and ended with Ukrainian forces recapturing the city.

The battle was part of a larger operation to encircle Kyiv, the capital city of Ukraine. The Ukrainian forces resisted the Russian advance in the capital's western suburbs of Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel. The battle was marked by fierce urban fighting.

## Prelude
On 25 February, Russian forces advanced on the suburb of Hostomel and its airport from the northwest after partially breaking through Ukrainian defenses at Ivankiv, capturing the airport and establishing a foothold in the town. Though there was still ongoing Ukrainian resistance in Hostomel, Russian forces began to advance south to capture the neighboring cities of Irpin and Bucha, with the goal of encircling Kyiv.

Later that day, a Russian column was defeated by Ukrainian forces near Irpin. On 26 February, residents of Irpin reported that Russian saboteurs were disguising themselves as Ukrainian soldiers.

On 25 February, due a lack of communications with the main invasion command, a convoy of OMON and SOBR units from Kemerovo Oblast accidentally separated from the invasion forces and ended up charging at Kyiv by themselves.

Reportedly, of the 80 soldiers in the convoy, only 3 wounded men survived.

On 27 February, Ukrainian forces reported that Russian Ground Forces had advanced into Bucha, breaking through the city and advancing towards Irpin.
