On 24 February 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine in a steep escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The campaign had been preceded by a Russian military buildup since early 2021 and numerous Russian demands for security measures and legal prohibitions against Ukraine joining NATO.

## Prelude

#### December
 * 7 December – US President Joe Biden warns President of Russia Vladimir Putin of "strong economic and other measures" if Russia attacks Ukraine.
 * 17 December 2021 -- Putin proposes a prohibition on Ukraine joining NATO, which Ukraine rejects.


### 2022


#### January
 * 17 January – Russian troops begin arriving in Russia's ally Belarus, ostensibly "for military exercises".
 * 19 January – the US gives Ukraine $200 million in security aid.
 * 19 January – Biden states in a press conference: "Russia will be held accountable if it invades. And it depends on what it does."
 * 24 January – NATO puts troops on standby.
 * 25 January – Russian exercises involving 6,000 troops and 60 jets take place in Russia near Ukraine and Crimea.


#### February
 * 10 February – Russia and Belarus begin 10 days of military maneuvers.
 * 17 February – fighting escalates in separatist regions of eastern Ukraine.
 * 21 February – Vladimir Putin ordered Russian forces to enter the separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.
